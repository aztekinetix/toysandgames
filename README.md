Demo of a Single Page App (SAP) with Web API and AngularJS

This is a demo app where we store toy info into a Json txt file. 
The Repository pattern was implemented to save and retrieve data from the Json txt file.
Web Api was used to create a REST Web service
Angular was used to communicate with the API and perform the CRUD operations.
